### Integration

1. In the Libp2p Ping Geolocation Library, integrate the Challenge-Response Protocol by requiring nodes to solve the challenge and verify their solutions before participating in the geolocation process.

2. When a node successfully solves a challenge and verifies its solution, call the `updateScore` function on the smart contract to update their score.

3. Use the `getScore` function to retrieve the scores of nodes and incorporate them into the reputation system, reward mechanism, or other aspects of the geolocation process.

By implementing a Challenge-Response Protocol and a smart contract for logging scores, you can strengthen the security of the Libp2p Ping Geolocation Library and incentivize honest participation in the geolocation process.
