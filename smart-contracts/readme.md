# Libp2p Ping Geolocation Staking Contract

The Libp2p Ping Geolocation Staking Contract is an Ethereum smart contract designed to work with the Libp2p Ping Geolocation Library. It provides a staking mechanism, a scoring system for challenge-responses, and a fair reward distribution for participating nodes in the geolocation process.

## Overview

The smart contract is developed using Solidity and can be deployed on the Ethereum network. It allows nodes to register and stake tokens to participate in the Libp2p Ping Geolocation process. Nodes can increase or decrease their stakes over time, and their performance in challenge-responses is tracked using a scoring system. Rewards are distributed fairly among participating nodes based on their stakes and scores.

## Features

- Node registration and unregistration with a minimum stake requirement
- Functions to increase and decrease stakes
- Scoring system based on challenge-response performance
- Fair reward distribution mechanism
- Reward pool deposit function
- Events for node registration, unregistration, stake changes, score updates, and reward distribution

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum network using a tool like [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

2. Integrate the smart contract with the Libp2p Ping Geolocation Library, such that nodes must register and stake tokens using the contract before participating in the geolocation process.

3. Require nodes to solve challenge-responses and update their scores on the smart contract accordingly.

4. Distribute rewards fairly among participating nodes using the reward distribution function provided by the smart contract.

## Example Functions

- `registerNode()`: Register a node by sending the minimum stake, payable with Ether.
- `unregisterNode()`: Unregister a node and reclaim its stake.
- `increaseStake()`: Increase a node's stake by sending additional Ether.
- `decreaseStake(uint256 amount)`: Decrease a node's stake by specifying the amount to withdraw.
- `updateScore(uint256 newScore)`: Update a node's score based on challenge-response performance.
- `getNodeInfo(address nodeAddress)`: Retrieve the stake, score, and registration status of a specific node.
- `depositReward()`: Deposit Ether into the reward pool.
- `getTotalContribution()`: Calculate the total contribution of all participating nodes.
- `distributeRewards()`: Distribute rewards fairly among participating nodes based on their stakes and scores.

## Events

- `NodeRegistered(address node)`
- `NodeUnregistered(address node)`
- `StakeIncreased(address node, uint256 amount)`
- `StakeDecreased(address node, uint256 amount)`
- `ScoreUpdated(address node, uint256 score)`
- `RewardsDistributed()`
