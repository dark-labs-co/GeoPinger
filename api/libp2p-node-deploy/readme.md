Make sure to replace the `https://github.com/yourusername/libp2p-node-typescript.git` URL with the URL of your own repository containing the libp2p-node-typescript code.

5. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.

6. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources on AWS. Confirm the deployment by typing `yes` when prompted.

7. After the deployment is complete, you can find the public IP address of your instance in the AWS Management Console or by running `terraform show` and looking for the `aws_instance.app.public_ip` attribute.

8. Access the application by visiting `http://<public-ip>:<app-port>/addresses` or `http://<public-ip>:<app-port>/ping?address=<multiaddr>` in your browser or using a tool like `curl`. Replace `<public-ip>` with the public IP address of your instance, `<app-port>` with the port your application is listening on, and `<multiaddr>` with a valid multiaddress for the `/ping` endpoint.

9. When you're done, run `terraform destroy` to clean up the resources created by Terraform. Confirm the destruction by typing `yes` when prompted.
